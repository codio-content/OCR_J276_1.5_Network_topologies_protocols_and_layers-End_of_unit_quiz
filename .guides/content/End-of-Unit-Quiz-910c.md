Now it’s time to think carefully about what you have learned in lessons 1, 2 and 3 about the transmission of data across the internet..

# Solution

Each node is connected individually to a file server or switch: **star**
All the nodes are connected to each other: **mesh**
There are alternative routes across the network. Even if one of the components fails there is always an alternative route for the data. **mesh**

# Solution

All devices on a network has a **unique** address called its **MAC** address so that data can be delivered to the correct device on a **LAN**. 
The technology and data transmission rules for **protocols** for wired networks are contained in the **Ethernet** standard whilst that used most for wireless networks **Wi-Fi**.

# Solution

Adds a header containing the source and destination MAC addresses: **Ethernet**
Used for sending email messages from client to server and then from server to server until it reaches its destination: **SMTP**
Divides the data into packets of the correct size: **TCP**
Adds the source and destination IP addresses to the packets and routes them to the recipient computer: **IP**
Used for the transfer of files between computers: **FTP**

# Solution

The layering of the protocols allows them to be **combined** in different ways as required. One layer can be **developed**  without affecting the other layers.
Layering makes it easier to identify and correct networking **errors**.
It provides a universal **standard** for hardware and software manufacturers to follow so that they will be able to communicate with each other.

# Solution

Data packets are transmitted across the internet using **packet** **switching**. The file is split into packets which are  addressed with the recipient’s **IP address**. **Routers** on the network inspect each packet and decide the most efficient path for the packet to take. The different packets can travel by different **routes**. If there is a problem with one part of the network packets can be **routed** around the problem. The same **line** can carry **packets** from communications at the same time.
